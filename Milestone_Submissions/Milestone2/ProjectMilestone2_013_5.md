##### Features:


###### Registration Page
New users will be able to create accounts with their emails, as well as be able to sign in to the website. When you are signed into the website you are directed to the user page with your information. Additionally, when you create an account you are also directed to your user page.
Database
The database is a way to store all the information that the website contains in a server so that users can easily access it when using the website. Information that needs to be stored includes: book data, user data, and all reviews.


###### Home/Explore Page
The home page will feature a search bar where the user can input any book they want, and will be directed to the books page for that book. Additionally, there will be a display of the top three genres currently available, as well as the top three books in those genres. Moreover, there is a general top 5 books display for the users as well.


###### Book Page
This page will pop up whenever a specific book is clicked on. It will include a cover of the book and any important information about it, as well as all reviews by different users and an average star rating at the top.


###### User Page
A page displaying a userâ€™s profile information. This will include: books reviewed, books read, books on reading list, profiles that the user is following, and profiles that the user follows.

##### Individual Contributions:


###### Lucas: 
I created a data model in SQL using normalization to show how the database for our application will be organized into tables. In addition, I helped create the project plan and organized this document so that it has everything it needs.

###### Sarthak:
Worked on the wireframe design, mapping out how each page in our web application will look for the UI. Created the JIRA board for our group project, and made a use case diagram that depicted the hierarchy of our users and the actions they will be able to use. Currently, working on the registration page.
